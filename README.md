# Winding-MMF-optimization
A genetic algorithm is used to find the best set of winding schemes for electric machines in single or multiphase systems that exhibit low magnetomotive force distortion (MMF).

* The first condition: The winding must have an integer number of coils per phase, as shown in Eq. 01.
\begin{align}
 n_{lay}\frac{N - n_{es}}{2m} \in \mathbb{N},  \\
\end{align}
